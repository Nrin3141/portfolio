  Rico's Blog - Run with Gatsby
</h1>

This is a project where I learn to use Gatsby - probably together with some headless CMS like Ghost for blogging. 
So far I freaking love it. The documentation is superb, examples are on point and extremely user friendly. 
ALL the explanations I have read so far are crisp and crystal clear. Down to the point. 

Seriously if you have not tried Gatsby yet - what are you waiting for. Developing your own super awesome blog with SEO and Search and Responsive Images has never been easier.
